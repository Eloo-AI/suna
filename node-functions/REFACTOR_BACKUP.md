# Refactor Backup Files

This directory contains backup files from the major refactor completed on [current date].

## Backup Files:
- `index.js.backup` - Original monolithic index.js file
- `flowAgentService.js.backup` - Original FlowAgent service file
- `logger.js.backup` - Original logger file
- `deploy.sh.backup` - Original deployment script

## New Structure:
All functionality has been moved to the new modular structure under `src/`:

```
src/
├── handlers/           # Function handlers by category
├── middleware/         # Reusable middleware components  
├── services/          # Business logic services
├── utils/             # Utilities and helpers
└── index.js           # New entry point
```

## What Changed:
- **Removed 4 obsolete functions**: `initiateSession`, `pollAndDownload`, `stopAndDeleteSandbox`, `stopAgent`
- **Modular architecture**: Separated concerns into middleware, services, utils
- **Enhanced deployment**: New batched deployment scripts
- **Better documentation**: Comprehensive API docs and guides
- **17 active functions** (down from 20, more maintainable)

## Safe to Delete:
These backup files can be safely deleted once the refactor is verified working.
The new architecture provides all the same functionality with better organization.
